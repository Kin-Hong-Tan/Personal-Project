## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : Placeholder.

 
- ### Challenges
    - [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/SQL): Placeholder.
    
- ### Ranking Algorithms
    - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season.
    - [Ranking of Tennis players](https://github.com/archd3sai/Tennis-Players-Ranking/blob/master/TennisRanking.ipynb) : Objective of this project is to rank all Tennis Players based on the matches they played in the year of 2018. This project comprises 4 approaches to rank Tennis players and I have tried to make these approaches more robust sequentially.
